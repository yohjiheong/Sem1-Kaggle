# Sem1-Kaggle

This is ym Semester One's Project in Forward School. Also my first time doing a kaggle project.

Project title is "Global Suicide Rates Analysis and Possible Reason People Committed Suicide." , I had to use severals datasets to be able to do this project, because datasets about global suicide rates are very little.

Links to all the datasets I had use is in the notebook named after - Yohji_KaggleProject . 

There is a total of 10 Methodologies and more than 10 graphs. Library like pandas, plotly, etc. is used. 
I seperate the whole project in to 2 notebooks, because if I have to load all of them in one notebook, it will crash due to the very very big files.
As mentioned the notebooks are seperate to two parts, one is for NLTK/Word Cloud, and another one is all for plotly graphs.

Please let me know if I can improve my code somewhere.

Thanks! :D
