# Sem1-Kaggle

This is my Semester One's Project in Forward School. Also my first time doing a kaggle project.

Project title is "Global Suicide Rates Analysis and Possible Reason People Committed Suicide." , I used severals datasets to be able to do this project, because relevant datasets are very little.

Links to all the datasets I used is in the notebook named after - Yohji_KaggleProject . 

There is a total of 10 Methodologies and more than 10 graphs. Library like pandas, plotly, etc. is used. 
I seperated codes in to 2 notebooks, because if I have to load all of them in one notebook, it will crash due to all of the big files.
As mentioned the notebooks are seperated to two parts, one is for NLTK/Word Cloud, and another one is all for graphs.

Please let me know if I can improve my code somewhere.

Thanks! :D
