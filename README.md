# Sem1-Kaggle

This is ym Semester One's Project in Forward School. Also my first time doing a kaggle project.

Project title is "Global Suicide Rates Analysis and Possible Reason People Committed Suicide." , I had to use severals datasets to be able to do this project, because datasets about global suicide rates are very little.

Links to all the datasets I had use is in the notebook named after - Yohji_KaggleProject . 

There is a total of 10 Methodologies and more than 10 graphs. Library like pandas, plotly, etc. is used. 
Please let me know if I can improve my code somewhere.

Thanks! :D
